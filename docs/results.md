### Discussion
- 8/10 of the final bodies were 5 links --> really low generations usually had the best body being with more links since they were often off balanced and would kind of roll forward but the simpler bodies later had more range of motion and had the ability to perform a sort of locomotion 
- one of the bodies that didn't have 5 links had 6 (seed 4) and still had a similar hopping motion but the extra link was a small one that didn't interfer with anything
- the other body would fall over (seed 8) and then it used it's links to push itself along the ground 
- all motion resembled hopping motion 

- lineages looked similar to a totem pole where they were fairly upright and then they used the other links to balance either left or right

- Large and complicated how they got stuck? what did they lack? what there something about them?

- How did you dig further into a detail of the results? Additional analysis?
