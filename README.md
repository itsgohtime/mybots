### How to run 
1. Open start.py and run the file to run Asn_6

### What I Did?
-  Created a program that generates a kinematic chain with a:
    - random number (3-8) of
    - randomly shaped links (0.25 - 1 for length, width, and height) with
    - random sensor placement along the chain.
- Links with and without sensors are colored green and blue, respectively.
