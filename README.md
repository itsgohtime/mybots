### How to run 
1. Open constants.py to change number of generations and population size
2. Open search.py and run the file to run final_project for seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
    - The seeds can be also changed in search.py by changing what the for loop variable num is 
        - For example, change line 9 to "for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]" to have seeds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
3. When each simulation is finished, it will prompt if you are ready; any input will cause the final simulation to be shown.
4. The next seed will run when the plot is closed. 
5. At the end of the indicated nubmer of seeds, the fitness curves plot will be shown.
