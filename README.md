### How to run 
1. Open constants.py to change number of generations and population size
2. Open search.py and run the file to run Asn_8 for seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
    - The seeds can be also changed in search.py by changing what the for loop variable num is 
        - For example, change line 9 to "for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]" to have seeds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
3. When each simulation is finished, it will prompt if you are ready; any input will cause the final simulation and plot to be shown.
4. The next seed will run when the plot is closed.
